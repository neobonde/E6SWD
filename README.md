# E7SWD
This is a Repository for all my exercises in the elective course E7SWD on Aarhus University.
It is a elective course for Electronics Engineers, but a main course for Information and Comunications Engineers at AU, where it is called I4SWD or Software design. [Course description](http://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/76627)

## Structure
The repository is broken up into weeks acording to the blackboard page for the course in the fall of 2017, with Michael SÃ¸rensen Loft and Henrik Bitsch Kirk as instructors  
With in each Week it should be one Visual Studio Solution per problem. meaning similar exercises are grouped in one soulution
